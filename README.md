## 🔄 Offseason Moves + X‑Factors

### **Baltimore Ravens**

* **New Additions**:

  * CB **Jaire Alexander** (1‑year, \$6M) strengthens secondary alongside Humphrey/Wiggins
  * CB **Chidobe Awuzie** adds veteran nickel depth 

* **Cap & Staff**: Limited cap space (\~\$10.5M) to re-sign big names; offense retains cohesion.

**Impact**: Defensive secondary gets a serious boost, potentially limiting Buffalo’s pass game and quick throws.

---

### **Buffalo Bills**

* **Key Re-signings**:

  * QB **Josh Allen** signed to a 6‑year, \$330M extension—record guarantee 
  * WR Khalil Shakir, LB Terrel Bernard, DE Greg Rousseau all extended

* **New Faces**:

  * Edge rusher **Joey Bosa** (1‑year, \$12M) to shake up Bills pass rush 
  * DTs **Larry Ogunjobi**, **Michael Hoecht**, plus rookies to reinforce DL — albeit with early suspensions for Ogunjobi/Hoecht
  * Secondary strength with **Maxwell Hairston**, **Tre'Davious White**, **Dane Jackson**

**Impact**: Buffalo's defense sees a significant overhaul—expect more pressure on Lamar and tighter pass coverage.

---

## 🧠 Tactical Preview

* **Run vs. Run**: Ravens thrive on ground game exploitation—watch their interior OL and Henry vs. Buffalo’s defensive line reinforced by Ogunjobi/Bosa.
* **Pass vs. Pass**: Bills with Allen and top-tier secondary will test Ravens’ revamped corner duo of Humphrey–Alexander–Awuzie.
* **Offensive Balance**: Both teams are highly balanced—game flow may be dictated by pre-snap formations, shotgun usage, and situational tendencies like RPO vs. play-action.

---

## ✅ Key Storylines to Watch:

1. **Ravens’ Secondary vs. Bills WRs** — Can Alexander/Awuzie limit Buffalo’s big-play threats?
2. **Bills’ New DL vs. Ravens RB Depth** — If Ogunjobi/Bosa disrupt, Ravens’ run game may sputter.
3. **Schemed Response** — Coaching chess between McDermott and Harbaugh—who adapts faster?

---

## 🏁 Summary

* **Offensively**, both are elite—Ravens hold a slight edge in efficiency and balance.
* **Defensively**, both bolstered units—Baltimore added premium corners, Buffalo enhanced DL and secondary.
* Their matchup promises a chess match of **scheme** and **matchups** in trenches and pass defense.
